Submit your final project proposal on Canvas [here](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2249389/assignments/16927258).
The file format should either be a text file or PDF.

Everyone should submit a final project proposal
(It's OK for it to be a duplicate of the proposal
submitted by the other members of your team.)

Include the following information in your final project proposal:

* The names of your team members.

* If you are choosing to do one of the book chapters for your
  final project, state which one:
  
    * Lexically Scoped Functions
    * Dynamic Typing
    * Gradual Typing (depends on Dynamic Typing)
    * Generics (depends on Gradual Typing)

* If you are choosing something else, please describe your project in
  about 1 page of text, including the following information:

    * Are you adding a new language feature? If so, describe the syntax,
      type checking, and runtime behavior of the feature. Give an
      example of how to use the feature in a simple program.
      Will you need to implement any new passes? Describe them.
      What existing passes will need to change? Sketch how they need to change.

    * Are you adding an optimization to the compiler? If so, give
      an example of how the optimization would change a program.
      What kinds of programs do you think will execute faster?
      What kinds of programs do you think will execute slower?
      Why do you think this optimization will not change the observable
      behavior of any program?
